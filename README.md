Creative Coding I . DATT 2440
Course Director: Dan Tapper <dantap@yorku.ca>

This course introduces students to writing computer code that is the basis for creative projects. As software now pervades all aspects of contemporary culture, artists and designers can significantly expand their creative palettes through knowledge of and experience with coding. By engaging with the computer more directly students explore the potentials of software to create and form systems and environments. In course projects, students will address contemporary aesthetic and conceptual concerns, and develop their works in a current creative coding environment with coding concepts explored transferable to a range of related development environments.

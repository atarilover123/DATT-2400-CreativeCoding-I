## Math Art Code

Math Art Code . DATT 2040
Course Director: Dan Tapper <dantap@yorku.ca>

Math Art Code explores relationships at the intersection of math, art and creative coding by providing a survey of mathematical concepts and techniques that support creation processes in contemporary code-based art and performance practices. Through a series of weekly studies reviewing mathematical concepts, their programmatic applications and investigations into the artists who employ them, we will build our own creative coding toolset. This toolset can be applied to the creation of computational artworks, such as video games, mixed reality, digital fabrication, and image manipulation and will provide a pathway from simple computational sketches to more advanced projects.
